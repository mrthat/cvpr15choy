TODO / NOTES / QUESTIONS

- should Section 3.3 (Variations of WHO) be moved into the experiments section? It describes the experiments we did to show that NZ-WHO is superior to the existing similar methods. (chris : It validates the NZ-WHO but it is an experiment should we move it to experiment and cite the result?)

- Section 4 needs to be expanded significantly

- We could discuss any pre-processing that the CAD models required
