%\subsection{Object Detection and Viewpoint Estimation}
%
Modern object detectors generalize very well, handling intraclass variability,
occlusion, truncation and viewpoint changes \cite{Felzenszwalb10, Girshick14}.
However, this generalization comes at the cost of fine-grained information,
including accurate 3D pose and object sub-category recognition. Such methods
typically produce bounding box detection hypotheses, with little further
information.

Many methods have attempted to move object detection towards richer outputs,
especially by jointly performing detection and pose estimation \cite{Pepik12,
Xiang12, Fidler12, Xiang14, Hejrati14, Aubry14, Lim14}. To achieve this,
\cite{Xiang12, Hejrati14, Fidler12} use 3D representations that deform as
viewpoint changes and \cite{Pepik12} uses geometric constraints to regularize 2D
appearance models.

The methods above perform discrete pose estimation, quantizing the viewing
sphere into a number of poses and selecting the best one during inference.
Fine-grained pose estimators, in contrast, can infer continuous (or arbitrarily
fine-grained) poses. One such method from \cite{Zia13} aligns a 3D deformable
part-based wireframe model with input images to accurately predict object poses.

More recently, \cite{Aubry14, Lim14} made progress in joint instance-level
object detection and pose estimation. To estimate pose they use synthetic
renderings of CAD models to learn discriminative mid-level patches.
\cite{Aubry14} calibrates these patches on a small set of real images, while
\cite{Lim14} presents a method for learning the relative discriminativeness of
the patches.
